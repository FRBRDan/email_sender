## About
This program receives an addressee email & name as arguments. It sends an index.html template, personalizes the HTML page by substituting the 'name' parameter with the addressee's name, and utilizes the SMTP protocol to send it. 

Note that this sends the email from my personal email only, so the use of SMTP is done with a fictional email & password.
